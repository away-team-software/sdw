  <section id="abstract">
    <p>The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing
      observations, in terms of the procedures executed and sensors used, the properties observed, which relate to the
      features (entities) of interest.
      Sensor stimuli, and aggregations of observations are included, relationships to other elements of the process.
      Samplings using samplers, and actuations using actuators are described using essentially the same terminology and
      relationships, which is described with common superclasses Execution and System.

      The core classes and properties are defined using minimal axiomatization in a module called SOSA (Sensor,
      Observation, Sample, and Actuator).
      Additional axiomatization and terms are provided in further modules.
      These allow SSN to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale
      scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science,
      observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things.
      Alignments to some related ontologies are also provided, including to PROV-O and DUL.

      The preparation of this edition of the SSN Ontology was prompted by the publication of a new edition of ISO 19156
      [[OMS]] which had been a key source for the conceptual model underlying SSN.
      This document contains the canonical RDF- and OWL-implementations of OMS. </p>

    <!--  <p>This is the second published draft of the SSN since its original
        publication by the SSN-XG, the Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group        of the W3C. This is an incomplete draft to indicate the scope and style        of changes proposed to be made to the original SSN. This document is        both incomplete and inconsistent, but is being published at this stage        to solicit comment from the community of SSN users and would-be users.</p> -->
    <p>For <strong>OGC</strong> this is a Public Draft of a document prepared
      by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a
        href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>)
      â€” a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>).
      The document is prepared following W3C conventions. The document is
      released at this time to solicit public comment.</p>
